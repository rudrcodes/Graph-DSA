## GFG : Eventual Safe States -> Using Cycle Detection : 
#### Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/eventual-safe-states/1


### Time Complexity: Same as DFS
### Logic :
- Any node that is part of a cycle will never be a safe node.
- Any node that leads to a node that is part of a cycle will also never be a safe node.

### Code : 

class Solution {
    private:
    bool dfs(int node,vector<int> &vis,vector<int> &pathVis,vector<int> adj[],vector<int> &ans){
        vis[node]=1;
        pathVis[node]=1;
        for(auto it:adj[node]){
            //visit all the neighboring nodes in DFS manner
            //if it(node) not visited , visit it
            if(vis[it]==0){
                //visit it
                if(dfs(it,vis,pathVis,adj,ans)){
                //if dfs returns true , it means there's a cycle and this node is in that cycle and hence this node can never be part of the safe node group,
                // So mark this node as unsafe
                ans[it]=0;
                ans[node]=0;
                return true;
                } else{
                    ans[it]=1;
                }
            }
            else if(pathVis[it]==1 || ans[it]==0){
                //ans[it] ==0 -> states that the index is already visited and it is not safe
                //there's a cycle
                ans[it]=0;
                ans[node]=0;
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        pathVis[node]=0;
        return false;
    }
  public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(int v, vector<int> adj[]) {
        // code here
        // Any node which will be part of a cycle won't be a safe node
        //Thought Process :
        // Find path where we get cycle and mark those nodes not safe 
        vector<int> vis(v,0);
        //keeps track of whichever node is occurs/present in the path
        vector<int> pathVis(v,0);
        
        // 0 -> node is  unsafe 
        // 1-> node is safe 
        // -1 -> Don't know about that node
        //initially all will be safe
        vector<int> ans(v,-1);
        
        for(int i=0;i<v;i++){
            if(!vis[i] && ans[i]==-1){
                //not visited or if the node is safe , check it's safeness by checking if the node is present in any path
                //if it has cycle dfs returns true
                if(dfs(i,vis,pathVis,adj,ans)==false){
                    ans[i]=1;
                }    
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> safeNodes;
        int i=0;
        for(auto it:ans){
            if(it==1){
                safeNodes.push_back(i);
            }
            i++;
        }
        
    
        return safeNodes;
    }
};
